/TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
LET'S WHAT I DID IN TASK 1?
* this dataset have info about eash passenger.
now, i checked that passengers traveled in titanic are survived or not 
step-1:
first we chech basic info about dataset.
step-2:
first check how many rows and columns are in it.
step-3:
ok, we displayed first 10 records of survived people and the visualization of survived and unsurvived passenger in a titanic.
step-4:
we visualized how many passengers are in cruise based on their titles like (Mr,Mrs,Miss,etc..), then we visuvalized who are survived based on this.
step-5:
i drop columns that wont help with prediction.filling missing values and convert categerorical valurs into numeric

TASK-2 :
MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
Step - 1:
   * Goal: Predict a movieâ€™s IMDb rating using features like genre, director, actors, year, duration, and votes.
   * Why: Understand what influences ratings and build a tool to estimate them for new movies.
   so, here we first load dataset and gather information about that.we found how many null values are there.
step -2:
    * ok now we want to prepare a data set.
    * we want to choose model so here now i choose Random Forest Regressor .
step -3:
  * so first i want to import libraries.
  * then we want to train a model on known data and test an model with unkwoun data.
step -4:
    * next we initialize and train the model.
    * we evaluvate the prdictions.
step -5:
    * and then we made visualizations.

TASK-5 :
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION WITH PYTHON

Step - 1:
  * Goal: Detect fraud in credit card transactions using ML.
  * Why: To reduce financial risk and ensure security.

  We load the dataset and plot the class imbalance.

Step - 2:
  * Preprocess the data.
  * Scale "Amount" and "Time" for better accuracy.

Step - 3:
  * Prepare features (X) and target (y).
  * Split into training and testing sets.

Step - 4:
  * Use SMOTE to balance the dataset.
  * Oversample minority (fraud) class.

Step - 5:
  * Visualize the balanced class distribution.

Step - 6:
  * Train Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
  * Use the balanced data for both.

  Saved plots show class distribution before and after SMOTE.
